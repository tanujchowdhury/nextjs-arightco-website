- **Strategic advice –** Having an experienced professional on board who understands both finance and business strategy is key when it comes to making decisions about big-ticket items like growth strategy, mergers, acquisitions, or exits. A CFO is able to provide objective advice based on their extensive experience and understanding of industry happenings.
