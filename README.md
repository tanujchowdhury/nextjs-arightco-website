# [ArightCo](https://www.arightco.com) Website Development

Developed with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). Deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). This website was developed in about 1 month end-to-end with further improvements coming in the future. Currently the website does not have a database and pages are being served statically. 

## Design

The UI was replicated from a previous version from a different team of developers. Animations for modals, hover effects, and scroll were tweaked but the overall look and content of the website was kept the same.

## Review

I worked with the leadership and marketing teams to get feedback. Upcoming features include a blog page with CRUD functionallity and the Pricing page's UI overhaul.

## Ship

Vercel made deploying the website very simple. I can share preview links with the ArightCo team to get feedback on big changes while fixing bugs at any time.
