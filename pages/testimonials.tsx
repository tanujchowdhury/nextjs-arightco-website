Not only did they help fill the gap, but, they were integral to our movement off of an archaic accounting system that no longer supported our needs. They not only assisted with the migration to Quickbooks, but ensured that the system met all of our accounting policies and procedures. We’ve now been with Arightco for just over two years and all of our financial operations run like clockwork, including our audit, tax preparation, and financial reporting to the Board of Directors. We are exceptionally pleased with their work ethic and support."
