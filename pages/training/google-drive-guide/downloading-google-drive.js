          <p>
            At Arightco, Inc., we utilize Google Drive because we prioritize the
            security of our client’s data. Google Drive is a cloud-based
            document storage program. By storing all documents in the cloud, we
            can access them at any time and can remove access at any time. Some
            clients may use another cloud-based document storage like Dropbox,
            SharePoint, box, etc. If the client uses a different
            document storage system, the Client Partner will provide you with
            access to it. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The primary reason why{" "}

              we do <span className="text-red-600">NOT</span> store anything
              directly on our laptops
            </span>{" "}
            is so that our client’s information stays secure. Should your laptop
            be lost, stolen, or compromised in any way, we can remotely remove
            access to all files and ensure the security of our client’s data.

            This guide will walk you through the steps of downloading the Google
            Drive Application and the conventions we use to save shared files.
            To ensure ease of use and transition, we expect everyone to save all
            client information in the same format. This allows each staff member
            to easily transfer to a new client
