              Can I add a client or an employee of the client to a shared Google
              Drive?
            </span>{" "}
            Yes. They do need to have a Google account to access it though.

            <span className="font-bold">
              Can I limit the type of access a user has?
            </span>{" "}
            Yes. You can change or set a permission that has the needed access
            for the user.
          </p>

            <span className="font-bold">
              Can I access or save files through a browser or from file
              explorer?
            </span>{" "}
            It is recommended that you access and save files directly from the
            file explorer. As when some documents are opened through the browser
            it changes them to a Google file type (i.e., Google Sheets, Google
            Slides, Google Docs). This can cause issues with what has been saved
            to the file sometimes.

            <span className="font-bold">
              Where can I store my personal documents or documents that don’t
              need to be in a shared drive?
            </span>{" "}
            You can set up your own Google Drive to save your personal or
            non-client-related documents
          </p>
