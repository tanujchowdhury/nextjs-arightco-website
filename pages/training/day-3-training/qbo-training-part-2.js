          <p>
            Day 3 of your training will start with a call with the Training
            Manager to go over any questions on your day 2 training as well as
            finishing your QBO training. The training call will take place on a
            video conference platform (i.e., zoom, slack, or Google Meets).
          </p>

          <p>
            The final part of QBO training will cover the below areas of QBO:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li className="font-bold">⋅ Bank Feed</li>
            <li className="font-bold">⋅ Bank Reconciliations</li>
            <li className="font-bold">⋅ Reports</li>
            <li className="font-bold">
              ⋅ P&L Review – Checking your work For the Bank Feed, you will not
              be able to practice with it in the Demo Co QBO file.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The Demo Co QBO file is unable to link to a bank and so the training
            will be shown on a LIVE client’s bank feed. Once you start the
            training with your Manager or Client Partner, they will go over the
            bank feed with you for the client(s) you will be working on.
          </p>

          <p>
            For the Bank Reconciliations, you will not be able to fully practice
            with it in the Demo CO QBO file. The Demo CO QBO file is used for
            multiple purposes and so the balances in the bank account and
            transactions will not match to The practice Statements. You will be
            able to practice going into it and using it, but it will not balance
            to $0.00 so you will not be able to finalize a Bank Reconciliation.
          </p>

          <p>
            On day 2 of your training, the Training Manager sent you the
            step-by-step guide for QBO that is found in the shared Google
            Training & Templates Drive under Training and in the{" "}

              Recorded Training Folder
            </Link>
            . After the training, if you need to review any parts of what the
            Training Manager went over, you can watch the QBO Training Videos
            that are in the Shared Google Drive under Training and in the{" "}
