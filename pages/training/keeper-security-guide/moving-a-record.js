            If a record was shared or created outside of a folder, it will be
            listed below all your other folders. All records should be saved
            inside a folder. If you have records not saved to a folder, you can
            move them to the appropriate folder.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, click on the record that you want to move. Next, click on
            "Options". Select the Move To option.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, Select the folder you want the record moved to. Next, click
            "Choose". 
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, click "Move". You will now see the record in the folder it was
            moved to.
