            <p>Can my keeper account be reset if I forget my password? NO. The account cannot be reset. An entirely new account would need to be created. </p>
            <p>Can I share an individual record? NO. You should share the entire client folder and not individual records. </p>
            <p>What access should be given to those needing to be added to a folder? All folders should be set up so that users can edit records and manage users. </p>
            <p>Can I share a payment card in keeper? No. Payment cards are not shareable in Keeper. Please follow the process of sharing a screenshot in Slack and then deleting it from Slack once it has been used. </p>
            <p>How can I organize the records under a client? Create folders like how you have your Google Drive folders set up and move the records to the appropriate folder. </p>
            <p>Who can I reach out to if I have issues with my Keeper account? IT Support can help with some issues. You can reach out to them directly on Slack or send a message on the #ITSupport channel in Slack. </p>
            <p>Where can I keep my personal logins? Create a folder for your personal logins. These may include your QBTime, QBO, Arightco email, etc. logins.</p>
