            The Training Manager will provide you with in-depth training on the
            following systems: 
          </p>

          <ul>

            <li className="font-bold">⋅ Google Drive</li>
            <li className="font-bold">⋅ Keeper</li>
            <li className="font-bold">⋅ QuickBooks Online</li>
            <li className="font-bold">⋅ Bill (Formally bill.com)</li>

          <p>
            Your first call with the Training manager will be approximately 2
            hours and take place on a video conference platform (i.e., zoom,

            Arightco, Inc. uses and bill (Formally Bill.com). This training will
            be in-depth on how to use each system and allow you to ask any
            questions about areas of the systems or tools that you are not sure
            of how to use.
          </p>
